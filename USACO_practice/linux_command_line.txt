pwd - you should see a directory path printed out 

cd / - you can change the working directory using the "cd" command

cd .. - to go up to the parent directory

typing cd on its own is a quick shortcut to get back to your homr directory

mkdir /tmp/tutorial - creating a new directory
cd /tmp/tutorial

ls > output.txt - capturing the output of that command 

echo "This is a test" > test_1.txt - writing this text to this file

g++ name.cpp -o name && ./name

g++ ./name < inp.txt > out.txt
